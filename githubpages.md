There are tons of option sout there to host your website. Here are the choices I considered:(Order doesn't mean anything :) )
* Medium
* Static website using Azure Storage - Yes, you can create a static website from Azure Blob storage. 
* Using a marketplace image of any website hosting provider in public cloud. Eg, Wordpress on Azure
* Github pages. 

I selected Github pages as i want to understand the concept of latest buzz i.e. Github and don't want to remember a new syntax. I did a lot of markdown in the past to update dcoumentation for Azure Backup and so have some xperience with markup. Also, this is free and i need not run any infrastucrure to setup this. This eliminated static websites and wordpress. I eliminated Medium as anything meaningful with Medium costs money!
