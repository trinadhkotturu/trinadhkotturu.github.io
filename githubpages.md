## Why did I select Github Pages

There are many options to host your website. Here are the choices I considered:
* Medium
* Static website using Azure Storage - Yes, you can create a static website from Azure Blob storage. 
* Using a marketplace image of any website hosting provider in public cloud. Eg, WordPress on Azure
* Github pages. 

I selected Github pages as I didn't knew Github has pages through which you can create cool static websites until i saw a post from one of my friends in LinkedIn suggesting it to his network. I did a lot of markdown in the past to update documentation for Azure Backup and so have some experience with markup. Also, this is free and i need not run any infrastructure to setup this. This eliminated static websites and WordPress. I eliminated Medium as anything meaningful with Medium costs money!

Then I started looking at Github pages site and docs and want to abandon it if it took more than an hour to setup. But there is a reason why people love Github. I was able to setup and create this post under an hour and everything from familiar repository interface. Github, FTW(For the Win)!
